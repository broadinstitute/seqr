        This page provides a report of sequencing results across a list of known disease genes.
        For each gene, it displays all rare coding variants that were seen in any affected individual.
        It also shows meta info about the dataset for this gene, including whether there are any gaps in sequencing coverage and whether there is any evidence of potential copy number variation.
