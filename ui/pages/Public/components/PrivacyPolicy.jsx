    Please read these terms and conditions carefully before using this site.
    <br />

    The Garvan Institute of Medical Research (Garvan) values your privacy. This Privacy Policy
    (&quot;Policy&quot;) provides important information about how Garvan collects and uses your Personal
    Information (as defined in Section 5, 6 and 9 below) through the seqr platform.
    <br />

    Please make sure you review this Policy before using the seqr platform. If you have any
    questions about this Policy, please contact us at

        <b>Who is Garvan? </b>
        The Garvan Institute of Medical Research brings together clinicians with world-leading basic
        and translational researchers. We are patient-focused — our researchers break down barriers between
        traditional scientific disciplines to find solutions to disease. Garvan’s researchers have
        made significant advances in genome, epigenome, protein and cell analysis technology.
        We have revealed causes and treatments for diseases including diabetes, osteoporosis, cancer,
        immune deficiency and autoimmunity. We will refer to Garvan in this Policy as
        &quot;we,&quot; &quot;us&quot; or &quot;our.&quot;
        <br />

        This Policy applies to the seqr platform, which is a web-based application developed and0
        hosted by Garvan (the &quot;Platform&quot;). This Platform is used by both Garvan employees and
        external collaborators across the world to analyse genomic data. The genomic and other
        data hosted within the Platform (&quot;Genomic Data&quot;) remains owned and controlled by the
        data contributor who consented to the sample and provided the data to be uploaded.
        <br />

        Please note that the Platform may link to other websites that are not affiliated with
        us (&quot;Third-Party Sites&quot;). We may offer those links as a convenience to you but we are not
        responsible for the privacy practice of those Third-Party Sites. You should make sure
        you review the privacy policies for those Third-Party Sites before providing them any
        of your information.

        <b>What is the purpose and scope of this Policy? </b>
        This Policy describes the Personal Information we collect from users of the Platform,
        the purposes for collecting that information, how we use that information, and with
        whom we share that information. Please note that this Policy only applies to
        information that we collect about users of the Platform, and does not apply to
        Genomic Data about Research Participants that may be contributed by users to the Platform.
        <br />
      </List.Item>
      <List.Item>
        <b>Does this Policy Apply to Genomic Data Uploaded to the Platform? </b>
        This Policy only applies to information that we collect about users of the Platform,
        and does not apply to Genomic Data contributed by users to the Platform. While the
        Platform also allows users to view and contribute Genomic Data for research purposes,
        the relevant Genomic Data contributor is responsible for obtaining all necessary
        permissions and consents for such data. If you are a user of the Platform, you are
        required to keep the Genomic Data confidential and not to disclose such data to any
        third party, except other users of the Platform with permission to view it.
        If you are an individual whose Genomic Data has been uploaded to the Platform
        (a &quot;Research Participant&quot;) and have questions about the privacy or use of your
        Genomic Data, please refer to the research consent for the study you participated
        in for more information, including contact information.

        <b>If I use the Platform, am I agreeing to this Policy? </b>
        Yes. However, your use of the Platform is entirely voluntary and you have certain
        rights to control use of your information as described below. If you decide to
        use the Platform, you are agreeing that we can use your information as described
        in this Policy.
        <br />
      </List.Item>
      <List.Item>
        <b>How do we collect information from you? </b>
        We collect information about you in two ways. The first is information you
        voluntarily provide to us when you choose to do any of the following, none of
        which is required:
        <List as="ul">
          <List.Item as="li">
            register to use the Platform, such as when you create an account
            on the Platform, in which case we collect your name and email address;
          </List.Item>
          <List.Item as="li">
            use the Platform, such as comments, material or information you may
            post on or upload to the Platform (&quot;User Content&quot;); and;
          </List.Item>
          <List.Item as="li">communicate with us (e.g., by email).</List.Item>
          <br />
        </List>
        In all these cases, we only collect information that you have provided to us,
        except for information obtained through cookies and the tracking technologies
        noted below. The second way we collect information is through certain automated
        technologies that are used when you access our Platform. An example is a &quot;cookie&quot;,
        which is a small piece of computer code that is placed on your computer or other device
        that can be used for various purposes, such as to recognize a user or to track their
        activities on a website. We describe automated technologies in more detail in Section 7
        below. We collect various information through these automated technologies, including
        your Device Information as described in Section 6 below; your Location Information
        as described in Section 6 below; and how you use our Site and App, such as the web
        pages you view, the links you click, the length of time you visit our Platform, and
        the web page or web site that led you to our Platform.
        <br />

        Garvan uses physical security and other measures to ensure that personal information
        is protected from misuse, interference and loss; and from unauthorised access,
        modification and disclosure.
        <br />

        We maintain computer and network security by using firewalls, user identifiers
        and passwords to control access to our computer system.

            Device information includes such things as an IP address (which is a number assigned
            by an internet service provider to the computer you use to access the Internet),
            a device ID (which is a number assigned to a mobile phone by the device manufacturer),

        in this Policy, shall have the meaning ascribed to them by the European Union General Data
        Protection Regulation 2016/679 and its amendments (&quot;GDPR&quot;). With respect to User Supplied Data,
        we are a data processor or subprocessor for our users, who are either data controllers or data processors.
        As such, we are not liable for the provisions of GDPR that pertain to the data controllers as it relates
        to User Supplied Data. Our obligations as a data processor for User Supplied Data shall include those
        specified in Article 28 of the GDPR. If you make a request for User Supplied Data, we will submit that
        request to the provider of User Supplied Data for further instructions on such request, except to the
        extent we are required to act upon that request under GDPR.
        <br />

        We do act as data controllers for Personal Information that we collect directly from users themselves.
        In such cases, we rely on the following legal bases for processing such information:
