# The following paths must be:
#    1) absolute   (kubernetes configs don't resolve relative paths)
#    2) within your local HOME directory   (one kube-solo VM feature is that it automatically mounts
#       your HOME directory into the coreOS VM filesystem. If the Kubernetes Volumes hostPath
#       feature is then used to mount this coreOS VM directory into the Kubernetes pod(s)
#       (for example into the postgres or mongo pod), then any data that pod applications write into
#       this directory will exist outside the pod and coreOS filesystems, and will not be deleted
#       during pod delete-deploy cycles, or during coreOS VM destroy-init cycles - this is useful
#       for long-lived database data, or for code directories during development - so that code
#       can be edited in your local HOME directory outside kube-solo, but any changes are
#       immediately visible inside the coreOS VM and pods)
